# Introduction

I don't like Twitter's built in emoji.

I like Apple's OS default emoji.

This fixes that.

# Instructions

1. Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.
2. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
3. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome` subdirectory of this repository.

# Notes: 

This extension assumes that Twitter uses the Emoji class on their emoji <img> elements and that the alt attribute contains the emoji text. If Twitter changes their HTML structure or class names, you may need to update the extension accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that this extension replaces the emoji with their text representation, which may not render as actual emoji depending on the user's operating system and font support.
